# CZ Biohub DS Blog

This is the [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) project for the [CZ Biohub](https://www.czbiohub.org) Data Sciences group blog. It's based on the [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/) project created by Barry Clark, with a couple bug-fixes and some add-ons:

- Posts can use [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) by putting `mathjax: true` in the header section.
- Blocks of code can be hidden (showable via a button) with `codehide: true`.

### A note about PRs

Because this is a fork, PRs will default to pointing at the original repository, rather than to our own master branch. So make sure to change the branch when you are submitting a PR, otherwise you will open one against the original Jekyll-Now repo.

For any other info about the framework, check out the Jekyll Now site and [repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).
